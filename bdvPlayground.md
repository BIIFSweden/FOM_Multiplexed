# Inspecting multiple Tissue Cores using the BigDataViewer and BigDataViewer Playground in Fiji

Instructions by Anna Klemm, BioImage Informatics Facility, SciLifeLab, Sweden, March 2023.

**Background:**  
Images from tumor samples often show high variability in stain intensities. Further artefacts can be out-of-focus regions, air bubbles, edge effect of staining. 
Before starting analysis it is important to visually inspect the data.

**Aim:**  
Inspect image quality and staining intensities in the different channels in different cores.

**Tools:**  
We are using the BigDataViewer and BigDataViewer (BDV) Playground in Fiji.

## Example data set
The example data are 20 samples from lower grade glioma tumor patients ("tumor cores"). 
| Channel | Stain | Marker |  Main Cell Type |
|--------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|
| 1 | DAPI |  Nuclei | all |
| 2 | Opal 480 |    IBA1   | macrophages |
| 3 | Opal 520 | Ki67 | dividing cells |
| 4 | Opal 540 |    TMEM119   | microglia |
| 5 | Opal 570 | NeuroC | neurons |
| 6 | Opal 620 |    MBP   | (oligodendrocyte)|
| 7 | Opal 650 | mutIDH1 | glioma |
| 8 | Opal 690 |    CD34   | endothelial |
| 9 | Opal 780 | GFAP | astrocyte |
| 10 | Autofluorescence |    -   |    -   |


All procedures involving human specimens were 
approved by the regional ethical committee in Gothenburg (Ep Dnr: 1067–16), and informed consent was given by the patients. You can read more about the samples and the staining procedure in Solorzano *et al.*.

## Install BDV-Playground
Enable the `PTBIOP` Fiji update site via `Help>Update>Manage Update Sites`.  
A more detailled description on how to enable an update site can be found here: https://imagej.net/update-sites/following.

## Loading data into the BDV Playground
* Run `Plugins › BigDataViewer-Playground › BDVDataset › Open [BioFormats Bdv Bridge (Basic) (Legacy)]` to load images into the BDV-Playground.
* Choose the right physical unit of the dataset. Here: `MICROMETER`
* Add the files to inspect, e.g. by using `Add folder content...` to add all images in a folder.
* Press `OK`.

## Navigation to single images ('sources').
BDV-Playgrounds builds a tree of the sources, which makes it easy to inspect the images. For example we can easily inspect a certain channel.

Let's try this out:
* Navigate to `dataset > Channel > All Sources`. 
* Right-click on the first image with the name `resolution #1- Opal 480` and choose `BDV - Show Sources`
* Activate `Auto Contrast` and click `OK`.
The Opal 480 channel of the first image core is loaded into the BigDataViewer.
Close the window again, since this was just a first test.

## Displaying several core images in a grid
Our aim is to visualize all the core images in a grid, visualizing one single channel for inspection. Once displayed on a grid, we can visually compare e.g. staining intensities, artefacts etc.. between the individual tumor cores.
Steps:
* In the Fiji toolbar, choose ` Plugins › BigDataViewer-Playground › Sources › Display Sources On Grid`. 
* In the Sacs window, navigate to  `dataset > Channel`. Click on `Opal 480` to select the Opal 480 channel of all the data sets (20 images in the example data set).
* Let's choose `NColumns = 5` to display the 20 images in a 4x5 grid. 
* Press `OK`.

## Adjustments and Navigation within the BDV
Please have a look on the BDV documentation to learn about navigation and displaying data: https://imagej.net/plugins/bdv/

For this exercise:
* hover over the right side of the BDV window to see two white arrows on blue background - click to expand the menu.
* select all sources using `SHIFT+click`
* select white as a display color for all the sources and the contrast limits `[0,10]`

The channel Opal 480 is now visible for all the 20 cores and we can inspect how well the different cores were stained. 

Basic Navigation:
* pan while holding the right click
* zoom: hold `CTRL+SHIFT` while zooming with the mouse wheel.
