# Using TissUUmaps for exploring QuPath output and cell-cell interactions
By Andrea Behanova

## Data
- TissUUmaps project: `.tmap` file containing all 10 TMA channels.
- Images: 10 channels of one image core (TMA core, .tif)
- Markers: GT from Lina, classification from QuPath (.csv)
- Regions: Geojson masks from QuPath  (.json)

In case something is not clear you can always search for help in our documentation: https://tissuumaps.github.io/TissUUmaps-docs/.

## General
1. Install TissUUmaps: https://tissuumaps.github.io/download/.
1. Load all 10 image channels into TissUUmaps. You can do it by dragging and dropping 10 individual `.tif` image files into TissUUmaps space, or by loading the `.tmap` file directly. All layers will be listed in the tab Image layers.

1. Now load the output .csv file from QuPath by clicking on tab Markers, clicking the `[+]` button, selecting the desired file from your computer under the section **File and coordinates - Choose file**.
1. You can change the Tab name to any desired name, then you need to select the column names from the .csv file corresponding to the X and Y coordinates.
1. In the section **Render Options**, you can define a key to group by, that is a column from the .csv file which will be used to display the dataset grouped by different colors and shapes of the marker.
1. Click the **[Update View]** button.
1. Now you can explore the classification results in form of the markers in the spatial view, you can zoom in or zoom out, select which groups should be displayed, etc.
1. To load the segmentation results from QuPath, you need to go to the tab Regions and press Import -> Choose File -> select the desired file from your computer and press the button Import.
1. All the segmentation regions are displayed on top of the image and you can fill them by clicking the check box next to the regions, or you can just fill all regions by clicking the button Fill all regions. Selected regions can also be analyzed by clicking the button Analyze group meaning displaying a list of all the marker keys with their counts inside that region (expression).
1. In order to present further TissUUmaps functions, we first need to install the plugins.
1. Open the menu **Plugins -> Add plugin**, check the boxes in front of the plugins ClassV&QC and InteractionV&QC, click Install, and re-start TissUUmaps.

## Classification comparison:

> To simplify saving TissUUmaps projects, always keep all files used in a common project (`.tif` and `.csv`) inside one folder.

1. Open TissUUmaps.
1. Load all 10 image channels into TissUUmaps (from folder dataset_1_tma_cores/LGG_TMA_5_2_channels). You can do it by dragging and dropping 10 individual `.tif` image files into TissUUmaps space, or by loading the `LGG_TMA_5_2.tmap` file directly. All layers will be listed in the tab Image layers.
1. Now load the ground truth file `Core_5_10_B_GT.csv` containing manual annotations by clicking on tab **Markers**, clicking the `[+]` button, and selecting the desired file from your computer under the section **File and coordinates - Choose file**.

1. You can change the Tab name to any desired name, for example, `Core_5_10_B_GT`, then you need to select the column names from the `.csv` file corresponding to the X and Y coordinates.
1. In the section **Render Options**, you can define a key to group by, that is a column from the .csv file which will be used to display the dataset grouped by different colors and shapes of the marker, in this case, column GT.
1. Click the **[Update View]** button.
1. Now repeat steps 3-6 but for the neural network classifier file (`nameCore_5_10_B_FCNN.csv`) containing automated classification results.

1. Save the project as a `.tmap` file by opening the menu **File -> Save project**. In order to save the project together with the `.csv` file, it is necessary to generate a button first. A warning window appears and you need to generate the button. The path to the `.csv` file needs to be relative to the path of the image.
1. Then you select a suitable directory to save the project and write the project file name, i.e. `My_project.tmap`, and the project is saved.
1. Open the plugin `ClassV&QC` by clicking the menu **Plugins -> ClassQC**.
1. In the pluginâ€™s dropdown menu `Select marker Dataset 1` - select the ground truth dataset (`Core_5_10_B_GT`), in the dropdown menu `Select column of Dataset 1` - select the column of Dataset 1 containing the classification results (`GT`), in the dropdown menu `Select marker Dataset 2` - select the automated classification dataset (`Core_5_10_B_FCNN`), in the dropdown menu `Select column of Dataset 2` - select the column of Dataset 2 containing the classification results (FCNN).
1. Check the box to see the confusion matrix.
1. Click the Display button and explore misclassification from the spatial point of view and use the interactive confusion matrix. You can click on the cells and see the cropped patches from all 10 channels. The size of the displayed patches can be adjusted in the settings Figure size.

## Interaction:

> **Note**  
> To simplify saving TissUUmaps projects, always keep all files used in a common project (`.tif` and `.csv`) inside one folder.

1. Open TissUUmaps.
1. Load a DAPI image. You can do it by dragging and dropping the .tif image file into TissUUmaps space.
1. Now load the `.csv` file of one classification marker dataset (`Core_5_10_B_GT.csv` or `Core_5_10_B_FCNN.csv`) by clicking on tab Markers, clicking the `[+]` button, selecting the desired file from your computer under the section **File and coordinates - Choose file**.
1. You can change the Tab name to any desired name, then you need to select the column names from the .csv file corresponding to the X and Y coordinates.
1. In the section **Render Options**, you can define a key to group by, that is a column from the `.csv` file which will be used to display the dataset grouped by different colors and shapes of the marker.
1. Click the **[Update View]** button.
1. Save the project as a `.tmap` file by opening the menu **File -> Save project**. In order to save the project together with the .csv file, it is necessary to generate a button first. A warning window appears and you need to generate the button. The path to the .csv file needs to be relative to the path of the image.
1. Then you select a suitable directory to save the project and write the project file name, i.e. `My_project.tmap`, and the project is saved.
1. Open the plugin **InteractionV&QC** by clicking the menu **Plugins -> InteractionQC**.
1. Next, we want to calculate the neighborhood enrichment test (NET) and save the results as a .csv file: Click on this <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1KN9hkFp_ZpJcB4jQxajHlHNHbMe0Ts4N?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Google Colab link</a> and copy the notebook to your drive by clicking `File -> Save a copy in Drive`. Now the notebook has been copied to your Google Drive.
1. Upload the `.csv` file which will be analyzed by clicking the icon of a folder (![](images/folder.png?raw=true "Folder")) saying `Files` on the left panel, then clicking icon ![](images/upload.png?raw=true "Upload") saying `Upload to session storage` and choose the `.csv` file from your computer (`Core_5_10_B_GT.csv` or `Core_5_10_B_FCNN.csv`). The file will be subsequently uploaded into Google Colab.
1. Replace the file name with the one you uploaded at:
    ```python
    file_name = '5_10_B.csv' #define which file_name to load:
    ```
1. Define the column names of X, Y coordinates and the classification results at: 
    ```python
    #define column name containing X coordinates:
    X_name = 'cx'
    #define column name containing X coordinates:
    Y_name = 'cy'
    # define column name containing classification results:
    Classification = 'final_class'
    ```
1. Run the notebook, start by pressing the symbol play ![](images/play.png?raw=true "Play") in the first notebook element, then click on the second element and click on the tab `Runtime -> Run after`. This will result in saving the output matrix from NET and a `.csv` file named `Neighborhood_enrichment_test_file_name_squidpy.csv` in the local session. Download this file to your computer by left click on the file and selecting Download. (The result will be lost if the notebook is closed).
1. Now we can go back to the TissUUmaps software.
1. Open plugin InteractionV&QC by clicking the menu **Plugins -> InteractionQC**.
1. In the dropdown menu `Select marker dataset` - select the marker dataset which will be used for the interactive visualization of the NET matrix, 
1. In the menu `Select file` - select the `.csv` file from the computer which was downloaded from the Google Colab notebook.
1. Then click the button **[Display Neighborhood Enrichment Test]** to load the .csv file and displays an interactive matrix where you can click on the elements and see the corresponding two cell types on top of the displayed image in the spatial viewport.
